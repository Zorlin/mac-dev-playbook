# development-workstation-playbook
Automated setup of my workstations

Totally empty right now but this will use Ansible to set up my development machines and laptops hopefully as close to fully automatically as possible!

Hugely inspired by https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook and will use code and examples from it
