# development-workstation-playbook
Automated setup of my macOS workstations.

Hugely inspired by https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook and will use code and examples from it.

## Instructions
* Run setup.sh, sip coffee
* ansible-playbook site.yml, sip more coffee
* Breathe a sigh of relief unless something went wrong
